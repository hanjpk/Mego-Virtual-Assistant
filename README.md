# Mego Virtual Asisstant App

This app us meant to be my project for Hackathon HMKG 2024, but I didnt make it. So, I will make it public.

This app is about bringing the new fresh AI especially LLM (Large Language Model) technology to users can access and understand BMKG data. With LLM like Gemini, we can remove boundaries like language different, complex words, etc. LLM can understand human natural language and then return it with useful and understandable information for users.

## Getting Started

This app uses an environment variable for Gemini API Key. You can create your API key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). After that, you can rename `.env.example` to `.env`. After that you are good to go.
